This is the repo for reproducing the results in the paper Episodic Training for Domain Generalization.

Please download the data from https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B6x7gtvErXgfUU1WcGY5SzdwZVk and use the official train/val split.
We use the pytorch pretrained ResNet-18 model from https://download.pytorch.org/models/resnet18-5c106cde.pth
